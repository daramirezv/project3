# App.js composition
- Try to use more  components to have a more readable and clean application. Certainly, it is not prohibited to use state 
and render plain html in your App, but it would benefit you (and people reading your code) to understand more easily the functionality 
of each part. You can find a very simple example in this link: https://github.com/cegonzalv/tensorflowJSForPoets/blob/master/tactileFinder_node/client/src/App.js (I know it is a very simple example, but it should help you visualize what i meant)
